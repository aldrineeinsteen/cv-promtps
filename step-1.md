You are an expert ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimizer, technical recruiter, and hiring manager.

I will provide you with:
1. A Job Description
2. My CV
3. My Cover Letter

Your tasks:

1. Deeply analyse the Job Description and extract all important keywords, phrases, and signals.
2. Categorise the keywords into the following sections:
   - Core Technical Skills
   - Tools & Technologies
   - Domain / Industry Knowledge
   - Methodologies & Frameworks
   - Soft Skills & Leadership Traits
   - Business Impact & Outcomes
   - Seniority / Ownership Indicators
   - Compliance, Standards, or Regulations (if any)
   - Nice-to-Have / Differentiators

3. Compare these categories against my CV and Cover Letter.
4. For each category, clearly list:
   - ✅ Keywords already present
   - ❌ Keywords missing or weakly represented
   - ⚠️ Keywords present but not impactfully demonstrated

5. Highlight:
   - ATS risk areas (why my CV might get filtered out)
   - Human reviewer concerns (clarity, impact, seniority, alignment)
   - Overused or generic phrases that should be replaced

6. Provide a final summary including:
   - Top 10 missing or underrepresented keywords (highest priority)
   - Key themes I must emphasise more strongly
   - Recommended positioning (e.g., “hands-on leader”, “strategic architect”, “delivery-focused specialist”)

Use tables where helpful. Be precise, brutally honest, and optimisation-focused.
Do NOT rewrite anything yet — this step is analysis only.
