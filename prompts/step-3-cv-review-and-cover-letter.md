You are a senior hiring manager, ATS specialist, and executive-level cover letter writer.

I will provide:
1. The Job Description
2. The UPDATED CV (rewritten using XYZ / Google format)

Your tasks:

PART A — Final CV Review & Validation

1. Review the updated CV against the Job Description.
2. Assess:
   - ATS keyword coverage
   - Clarity and impact of XYZ-format bullets
   - Seniority and ownership signals
   - Consistency of narrative across roles
   - Alignment with the target role’s expectations

3. Identify:
   - Remaining keyword gaps (if any)
   - Bullets that are still weak, generic, or responsibility-focused
   - Overly long or dense bullets that reduce scannability
   - Redundant or repetitive achievements

4. Suggest **final micro-improvements only**:
   - Minor wording tweaks
   - Stronger verbs
   - Better quantification
   - Sharper outcomes

Do NOT fully rewrite the CV again unless absolutely necessary.
Summarise readiness as one of:
   - ✅ Strongly hire-ready
   - ⚠️ Hire-ready with minor tweaks
   - ❌ Needs further iteration

PART B — Cover Letter Creation

5. Create a tailored cover letter that:
   - Is fully aligned with the Job Description and updated CV
   - Reinforces key keywords and themes WITHOUT repeating CV bullets
   - Clearly explains:
     - Why I am a strong fit for this role
     - How my experience solves the company’s problems
     - What differentiates me from similar candidates

6. Structure the cover letter as follows:
   - Paragraph 1: Clear, confident hook + role alignment
   - Paragraph 2: 2–3 high-impact achievements mapped to job needs
   - Paragraph 3: Leadership, ownership, and cross-functional impact
   - Paragraph 4: Motivation for the company and closing CTA

7. Style guidelines:
   - Professional, confident, and concise
   - Human and authentic (not robotic)
   - No clichés or filler phrases
   - Length: ~¾ to 1 page maximum

8. Keyword strategy:
   - Naturally embed priority keywords identified earlier
   - Ensure ATS compatibility while remaining readable

9. Output:
   - Final polished cover letter
   - A short explanation of how the cover letter complements the CV
   - Optional: 2 alternative opening paragraphs with different tones:
       a) Direct & confident
       b) Mission-driven & thoughtful

Target outcome:
A CV + cover letter pair that tell one coherent story and make rejection difficult.
