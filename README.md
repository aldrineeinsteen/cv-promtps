# 🚀 AI-Assisted CV & Cover Letter Optimisation (ATS-Ready)

This repository contains a structured, multi-step prompt framework for analysing a job description, identifying gaps in a CV and cover letter, rewriting the CV using XYZ (Google) format, and finally producing a tailored, high-impact cover letter.

The goal is simple:

👉 Maximise ATS keyword coverage

👉 Strengthen seniority and impact signals

👉 Make the CV and cover letter hard to reject

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most CVs fail for two reasons:
1. They don’t speak the employer’s language (keywords, phrasing, priorities)
1. They list responsibilities instead of outcomes

This framework fixes both by:
* Reverse-engineering the job description
* Systematically identifying keyword gaps
* Rewriting experience using measurable impact
* Aligning the cover letter with the same narrative

⸻

## 🧩 The 3-Step Workflow

###🔹 Step 1 — Job Description vs CV & Cover Letter Analysis

Purpose:

Identify missing keywords, weak signals, and ATS risks before making changes.

Output:
* Categorised keyword list
* Clear visibility of gaps
* ATS and human-reviewer risk areas
* Priority optimisation themes

### 🔹 Step 2 — CV Rewrite Using XYZ (Google) Format

Purpose:
Rewrite the CV to clearly show what was achieved, how it was done, and why it mattered.

XYZ Format:

Accomplished X by doing Y, resulting in Z

Output:
* Outcome-driven CV bullets
* Strong seniority and ownership signals
* Natural keyword integration
* ATS-optimised structure

Prompt:
📄 step-2-cv-rewrite-xyz-format.md

⸻

### 🔹 Step 3 — Final CV Review & Cover Letter Creation

Purpose:
Validate the rewritten CV and generate a role-specific cover letter that complements it.

Output:
* Final CV quality check
* Minor wording and impact refinements
* Tailored, keyword-aligned cover letter
* Optional alternative opening paragraphs

Prompt:
📄 step-3-cv-review-and-cover-letter.md

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Paste the Job Description, CV, and Cover Letter into Step 1
1. Review the keyword gaps and optimisation feedback
1. Use Step 2 to rewrite the CV using XYZ format
1. Feed the updated CV into Step 3 to:
   * Validate readiness
   * Generate the final cover letter
1. Submit with confidence 💼✨

🎯 Best Use Cases
* Technical roles (Engineering, Architecture, Platform, DevOps)
* Senior or leadership positions
* Career transitions
* ATS-heavy application pipelines
* Highly competitive roles

⚠️ Important Notes
* This framework does not fabricate experience
* Metrics may be estimated but should be validated
* Always review outputs before submission
* Tailor for each role — reuse the framework, not the final CV

## 📌 Philosophy

Responsibilities describe what you were told to do.
Outcomes prove why you were worth hiring.
