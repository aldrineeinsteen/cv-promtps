🚀 AI-Assisted CV & Cover Letter Optimisation (ATS-Ready)

This repository contains a structured, multi-step prompt framework for analysing a job description, identifying gaps in a CV and cover letter, rewriting the CV using XYZ (Google) format, and finally producing a tailored, high-impact cover letter.

The goal is simple:
👉 Maximise ATS keyword coverage
👉 Strengthen seniority and impact signals
👉 Make the CV and cover letter hard to reject

🧠 Why This Exists

Most CVs fail for two reasons:
	1.	They don’t speak the employer’s language (keywords, phrasing, priorities)
	2.	They list responsibilities instead of outcomes

This framework fixes both by:
	•	Reverse-engineering the job description
	•	Systematically identifying keyword gaps
	•	Rewriting experience using measurable impact
	•	Aligning the cover letter with the same narrative

🧩 The 3-Step Workflow

🔹 Step 1 — Job Description vs CV & Cover Letter Analysis

Purpose:
Identify missing keywords, weak signals, and ATS risks before making changes.

Output:
	•	Categorised keyword list
	•	Clear visibility of gaps
	•	ATS and human-reviewer risk areas
	•	Priority optimisation themes

Prompt:

🔹 Step 2 — CV Rewrite Using XYZ (Google) Format

Purpose:
Rewrite the CV to clearly show what was achieved, how it was done, and why it mattered.

XYZ Format:

Accomplished X by doing Y, resulting in Z

Output:
	•	Outcome-driven CV bullets
	•	Strong seniority and ownership signals
	•	Natural keyword integration
	•	ATS-optimised structure

Prompt:
📄 step-2-cv-rewrite-xyz-format.md

⸻

🔹 Step 3 — Final CV Review & Cover Letter Creation

Purpose:
Validate the rewritten CV and generate a role-specific cover letter that complements it.

Output:
	•	Final CV quality check
	•	Minor wording and impact refinements
	•	Tailored, keyword-aligned cover letter
	•	Optional alternative opening paragraphs

Prompt:
📄 step-3-cv-review-and-cover-letter.md

🛠 How to Use
	1.	Paste the Job Description, CV, and Cover Letter into Step 1
	2.	Review the keyword gaps and optimisation feedback
	3.	Use Step 2 to rewrite the CV using XYZ format
	4.	Feed the updated CV into Step 3 to:
	•	Validate readiness
	•	Generate the final cover letter
	5.	Submit with confidence 💼✨

⸻

🎯 Best Use Cases
	•	Technical roles (Engineering, Architecture, Platform, DevOps)
	•	Senior or leadership positions
	•	Career transitions
	•	ATS-heavy application pipelines
	•	Highly competitive roles

⸻

⚠️ Important Notes
	•	This framework does not fabricate experience
	•	Metrics may be estimated but should be validated
	•	Always review outputs before submission
	•	Tailor for each role — reuse the framework, not the final CV

📌 Philosophy

Responsibilities describe what you were told to do.
Outcomes prove why you were worth hiring.
